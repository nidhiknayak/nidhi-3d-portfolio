## 🚀 About the Project

This portfolio template showcases my work through stunning 3D visuals rendered with WebGL. It's designed to be minimal, interactive, and immersive — built entirely using:

- `three.js`
- `react-three-fiber`
- `@react-three/drei`
- `react-spring` for smooth animations
I’ve customized this template to reflect my own projects and styling. Original template by Tomas Gonzalez.
